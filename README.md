# Unix Configuration

This repository contains my UNIX configuration.

All the files are built to be used on my working system.
This is more of a referance manual for me to build my system on other computers.
Some files are omitted due to security issues.
So this might not represent my complete setup.

* Installation to laptop.
* Installation to work PC.
* Setup
* Usage
