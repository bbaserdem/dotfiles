# To do and to fix

* Hibernate at low battery doesnt work.
* Suspend shuts down, fix it.
* Do keyboard layouts
* Figure out how to do a dropdown menu for planck keyboard layout.

Things to do later down the line (after a reinstall)

* Set up graphics drivers properly. (Should also fix polybar brightness)
* Get MATLAB hardware acceleration.
* Setup steam
* Setup CUDA
* Maybe find a better window manager? (Don't like how tiling works on bspwm)
* Setup snapper
* Setup firewall
